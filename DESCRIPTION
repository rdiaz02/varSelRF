Description: Variable selection from random forests using both
        backwards variable elimination (for the selection of small sets
        of non-redundant variables) and selection based on the
        importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree plots; for the
        selection of large, potentially highly-correlated variables).
        Main applications in high-dimensional data (e.g., microarray
        data, and other genomics and proteomics applications).
