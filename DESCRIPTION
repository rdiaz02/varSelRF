Title: Variable Selection using Random Forests
Author: Ramon Diaz-Uriarte <rdiaz02@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Ramon Diaz-Uriarte <rdiaz02@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.0.0), randomForest
Suggests: parallel
Enhances: Rmpi
Description: Variable selection from random forests using both
        backwards variable elimination (for the selection of small sets
        of non-redundant variables) and selection based on the
        importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree plots; for the
        selection of large, potentially highly-correlated variables).
        Main applications in high-dimensional data (e.g., microarray
        data, and other genomics and proteomics applications). You can
        use rpvm instead of Rmpi if you want but I've only tested with
        Rmpi.
